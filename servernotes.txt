#Working on no-chill scenario.

Trying to figure out how to get the server
thread to check whether it's out of sync.
So far:
	- adding check after getting turnGreenMsg
	- refactor change events
		- created changeEvents dictionary to allow indexing based on self.role
		- still need to refactor 
		- done
