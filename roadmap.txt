What are we doing?
	- Monitor traffic to server for attacks?
	- Monitor traffic both ways to detect rogue server as well?

Traffic Lights
	- Man in the Middle
	- Without System
		- Tap comms, change messages so says it's going green or says
		  it's staying red
		- does the opposite (gridlock or CRASH!)
	- With system
		- When it detects a lying system, makes all the lights
		  blinking red and Notifies police / administrators
